Decorators Theory:
    1. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function,
    without permanently modifying it.
    2. Before diving deep into decorators let us understand some concepts that will come in handy in learning the decorators.
    3. First Class Objects:
        Properties of first class functions:
            A function is an instance of the Object type.
            You can store the function in a variable.
            You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
            You can return the function from a function.
            You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦
