Generator Theory:
    1. A Generator in Python is a function that returns an iterator using the Yield keyword.
    2. A generator function in Python is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value,
        it does so with the yield keyword rather than return.
    3.Generators differ from standard functions in that they allow you to iterate through a sequence of values over time,
        instead of computing and returning a single result.
    4. Standard Functions: Compute a value and return it once. They use the return statement.
    5. The yield statement is used in a generator function to return a value and pause the functionâ€™s execution, preserving its state.
        When next() is called on the generator, execution resumes right after the yield.
    6. Benefits:
        Memory Efficiency: Generators generate values on the fly, reducing memory usage compared to storing the entire sequence in memory.
        Lazy Evaluation: Values are computed only when needed, which can lead to performance improvements, especially with large datasets.
        Maintain State: Generators automatically maintain their state between yield statements, making them suitable for iterative processes.
        Convenience: Generators simplify code for iterating over large datasets or streams of data without needing to manage state explicitly.
