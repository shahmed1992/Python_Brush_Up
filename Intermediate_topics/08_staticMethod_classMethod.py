    1. Class Method in python
        a. The @classmethod decorator used
        b. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance
          class C(object):
                @classmethod
                def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
                   ....
          fun: function that needs to be converted into a class method
          returns: a class method for function.
        c. A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
    2. Static Method in python
        a. A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
        b. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
        c. This method canâ€™t access or modify the class state.
        d. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.

        Syntax Python Static Method:

        class C(object):
            @staticmethod
            def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):
                ...
        returns: a static method for function fun.
